# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## Debugging Attitudes
* Developers sometimes assume that their code was written properly
* Instead, you should verify that your code works

## var_dump
* [`var_dump()`](http://php.net/var_dump) is still a valid way of debugging
* [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) and similar things can make `var_dump()` prettier
* If you are using `var_dump()` to the point that you need to make it look pretty, you should us a step debugger

## Logging
* Log interesting things, but don't go overboard
* Include useful information, like IDs
* Events should have the option for logging to be enabled

## Step Debugging
* Xdebug helps for step debugging amongst other things
* Step debugging allows you to pause a program at certain lines
* They are very good for debugging someone else's code

## Future of Debugging
* Debugging that allows you to view the history of a variable
