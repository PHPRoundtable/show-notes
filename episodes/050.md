# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## Getting Started
* Google is your friend, but one of the first hurdles is reaching a point where you know enough to search for solutions to your own problems.
* Books, User Groups, pair programming and mentoring can help with this.
* Break problems down into the smallest chunks possible - more specific questions are easier to find answers for.

## What is a user group and how do I get involved?
* A bunch of nerds talking about nerd stuff.
* A good way to meet other people using the same technologies.
* Search for PHP groups in your area on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/).

## Why should you choose PHP?
* PHP is specifically designed for web development.
* The barrier to entry is very low.
* It has a large standard library: you get a lot 'out of the box'.
* There's a lot of demand for PHP developers: PHP runs [82% of the world's websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all).

## Why should you not choose PHP?
* PHP is well suited to generating dynamic web content, but there are other languages better suited for other tasks.
* PHP is not available everywhere. For example, you can't develop an android app with PHP.
* Subjectively, many people think PHP has an ugly syntax.
* The standard library is very inconsistent. For example:
  * http://phpsadness.com/sad/9
  * http://phpsadness.com/sad/4
  * http://phpsadness.com/sad/48

## There's a lot to learn - how do we deal with this?
* Tackle one problem at a time - you don't need to learn it all at once.
* To be a programmer, you have to enjoy the process of finding solutions to problems.
* There are good habits and bad habits - focus on good habits and be prepared to re-evaluate bad ones.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help.

## My code isn't working - how do I find out what the problem is?
* Turn on [error reporting](http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php) in dev.
* [var_dump](http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php)
* Look at [step dubugging](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/debugging-is-more-than-var-dump) (tangent - [CppCast Episode 30](http://cppcast.com/2015/10/kate-gregory/))
