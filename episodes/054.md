# Summary
We chat about security in the the PHP community, encryption & hashing in PHP and a new-hotness crypto library called [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/).

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## PSR-9 and PSR-10
* [PSR-9](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/security-disclosure-publication.md) deals with the process by which security issues are submitted or reported to project maintainers.
* [PSR-10](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/security-reporting-process.md) describes a machine-readable format for disclosing security issues to users.
* [Roave/SecurityAdvisories](https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories) Prevents the installation of packages with known security vulnerabilities.
* [FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories) provides tools for identifying dependencies with known security issues.

## Encryption
* Encryption when you need decryption. Hash when you don't (e.g: passwords)
* Encryption provides confidentiality, [AEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) aims to go further.
* Message authentication/integrity checksum is usually a hashing problem, rather than encryption.
* Scott discusses some encryption pitfalls and how a simple operation like `==` can become very complex to implement securely without becoming vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Encryption is **hard** - don't roll your own. Leave it to the specialists.
* [RFC: OpenSSL AEAD support](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/openssl_aead)
* Always hash passwords with a slow hash function like bcrypt, scrypt or argon2 in [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/). Fast hash functions like sha-2 are more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
* [hash_pbkdf2()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.hash-pbkdf2.php) can be used to slow down your hash process to guard against brute-force by creating a bottleneck for an attacker. Don't DDOS your own server though: Use rate-limiting to avoid creating a DDOS vector.

## How do we upgrade the password hashing in legacy apps (e.g: md5)?
* Don't do a mass mailing and require a password reset from everyone: This implies a breach has taken place.
* Phased update - upgrade your userbase gradually:
  * Re-hash passwords using a new algorithm in the background each time a user logs in. Mark the user as re-hashed each time.
  * As users log in, force a password reset.
* bcrypt all the md5 hashes and make your hashing algorithm `bcrypt(md5($password))`

## Password Managers
* Make it easy for users to use password managers on your site
* Don't disable copy & paste on password fields
* Name password fields obviously

## libsodium
* [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) is a C library implementing best-in-class cryptographic and hashing algorithms
* Safe from side-channel and cache-timing attacks
* There are plans to move to libsodium implementations of built-in crypto function in PHP >= 7.2
* [mcrypt](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php) is deprecated in PHP 7.1
