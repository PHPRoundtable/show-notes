# Summary

No matter how experienced you are as a programmer, at some point your app will generate errors and crash. Fixing problems with your app quickly is paramount in order to affect as little of your user base as possible. We discuss what is involved with implementing effective logging and crash reporting techniques in PHP to help you keep your apps up and running like a well-oiled machine.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What are logs and why do we care about logging?
* Logs are streams of time-ordered events collected from a running process
* Logging can generate huge amounts of output
* Logs allow us to reason about our systems by telling us:
  * What is happening
  * When it is happening
  * Why it is happening
* We can use tools to help us to
  * Isolate relevant events based on queries
  * Notify us about important events (e.g: by email, slack, etc)

## What should we log?
* In general, log more rather than less
* There are some things we should not log:
  * Passwords
  * Personal data
  * Software with filtering can help with this
* Logging too much can impact performance

The de-facto standard for logging in PHP is [PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) and the most common logging library is [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)

## PSR-3 Defines a lot of log levels. How many should we use?
* `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING` and `ERROR` is probably enough for most apps
* The levels we use are based on the [syslog RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt)
* It depends on the scale of your application

## How can we visualise logs?
* `tail -f`
* The ELK Stack is popular, fast and (relatively) easy to set up
  * [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) indexes logs and makes them searchable
  * [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) collates the data from different log sources
  * [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is the visualisation layer for analysing the data

## Where should we write logs?
* Flat files and `logrotate`
* A buffering system like [Redis](https://redis.io/) or [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* Send logs to an aggregation service
