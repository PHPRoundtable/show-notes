# Summary

If you've ever gotten a number of weird looking characters in your database or on your website like, "ï¿½" and didn't know why, then this episode is for you. Those bizarre characters called "mojibake", rear their ugly heads when we don't account for a consistent character encoding. Today we discuss what character encoding is, how to accommodate for it in HTML, PHP & your database, and how we can ensure we'll never encounter an unexpected alien character in our web apps again.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What are character encodings?
* Comparison of number systems (base-10, binary, hexadecimal)
* Historical development of character maps and encodings (telegram, ASCII, ISO-8859-1...)
* Unicode and its implementations (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)
    * UTF-8 uses 1-4 bytes per character--shows all Unicode characters while keeping a small file size
    * UTF-16 uses 2 bytes per character, so results in larger files
    * UTF-32 uses 4 bytes per character, so results in even larger files

## Character encodings in PHP
* Some other languages have a UTF-8 core, while PHP stores strings a series of bytes--can result in misinterpretation/mojibake
* Mind the [multibyte string functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php):
    * E.g., [`strpos()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php) works by counting a number of bytes; this is unreliable for UTF-8, so use [`mb_strpos()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mb-strpos.php) for unicode strings
    * There is a php.ini setting (named?) which overloads functions like `strpos` with their multibyte versions. This it NOT RECOMMENDED as it can cause weird bugs, whether when switching hosts or when using 3rd-party code that wasn't written with this in mind.
* php7: the [IntlChar class](http://php.net/manual/en/class.intlchar.php) offers many useful static functions, e.g. [`IntlChar::chr()`](http://php.net/manual/en/intlchar.chr.php) and [`IntlChar::isWhitespace`](http://php.net/manual/en/intlchar.iswhitespace.php)
* php7: [`\u` escape for unicode codepoints](http://php.net/manual/de/migration70.new-features.php#migration70.new-features.unicode-codepoint-escape-syntax) in strings

## Character encodings in HTML
* HTML5: [`<meta charset="utf-8">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-charset)
* [`Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) HTTP header
* [`<form enctype="text/plain; charset=utf-8">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)

## Character encodings in MySQL
* MySQL default encoding is still `latin1_swedish_ci`--beware
* Only `utf8mb4` supports the full range of UTF-8 characters (as people have discovered from trying to store emoji)
* `varbinary` and `blob` consume less space than utf8 `varchar`, so they are useful in fields that users won't touch or whose contents never need to include special chars (e.g. URLs)
    * Is there any other tradeoff?

## Tips/best practices
* Save source files as UTF-8 without BOM.
* Always use `<meta>` and a `Content-Type` header.
    * Remember that [`header()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php) must precede any echoed output. (Presence of a BOM can cause bugs here.)
* Storing UTF-8 special characters in their native form (rather than as escaped sequences) in your source can act as "canary" for others--if I see mojibake, maybe my IDE/editor is not configured correctly?
* For MySQL, use `SET NAMES utf8` at the beginning of every connection
* Always validate inputs; always consider character encoding for input (whether from user or APIs), persistence, and output.
* Remember that connections/clients themselves _also_ have encodings
* Mismatched encoding bugs can hide among Roman alphanumerics, since ISO-8859 and UTF-8 are compatible in these lower codepoints. Check higher codepoints to be sure.
