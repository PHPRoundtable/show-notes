# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What to expect as a new Laravel person
* Laravel is a full featured framework for PHP that has pretty much most of what you need to develop a modern web app
* Some things that includes:
	* Routing: Inspired by Sinatra. Similar to Slim and Silix
	* ORM: Called Eloquent that is inspired by the Ruby on Rails implementation of the Active Record design pattern
	* Unit testing
	* Message queue library
	* Support for Web Sockets
	* Laravel Mix: Makes working with Webpack much easier
*  geared for Rapid Application Development because the syntax is really simple and intuitive
*  Strives to have good documentation; if you can learn it quickly, then you can build it quickly


## What is the best place to get started learning about Laravel?
* Jeffery has good videos on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com)
* Read the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) from beginning to end

## How does Taylor keep up with the ridiculous amount of PRs?
* Taylor gets to work on Laravel full time
* Has a Github page that has a list of all the PRs across all of the repositories
* Tries to keep the list of PRs down to 10-15
* Checks the PRs everyday for like an hour

## Has there ever been anything you wanted to implement in the framework that has been hindered by the PHP language itself?
* Real threads. Even though the [pthreads](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.php) extension exists, it is not common for it to be available
* Some collection / iterable things can't be passed into `array_map` or `array_filter`. You have to cast the object to an array before you can use it with those functions.

## Laravel has hired its first employee
* It is [Mohamed Said](https://twitter.com/themsaid)
* He has been on staff for roughly 6 months

## What is a typical day for employee #1 like?
* Usually starts the day looking at the Github issues and pull requests and triage them
* Tests new code on different environments
* Looks at tasks in the various Laravel projects and sees what needs to be worked on
* Lately have been studying Laravel Horizon; a project that is soon to be released
* Spends an hour or two experimenting with new features Mohamed has in mind. Checks Laracasts forums to see if he can write a blog article that can help developers understand something better

## What kind of influence has Laravel had on Adam's success?
* Lucky to be involved in a big community that is excited to learn new things and the same things he is working on

## Tools Adam finds exceptionally helpful when launching new products
* [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) - An email marketing automation tool. Makes it real easy to collect email address from people interested in your projects

## Refactoring to Collections
* Adam wrote a [book](https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/) about it
* Started the book when he started to discover some of the functional features of PHP

## What is `tap` and the higher order `tap`?
* The function `tap` allows you to pass in an object as the first parameter and a callable, like an anonymous function, as the second parameter. 
* More info on `tap` [here](https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/tap-tap-tap-1fc6fc1f93a6). PR for higher order tap [here](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/3abc4fb90fe59a90c2d8cccd27e310b20e5e2631)
* Was originally in Rails, but then added to the Ruby language. This is where the inspiration came from for the Laravel implemnetation

## New way to do Laravel Migrations in 5.5
* Some people think the `down` method in migrations is useless, specially in production, which can be dangerous
* Now `down` is optional in 5.5
* New `db:freash` command which drops all the tables and reruns all of the migrations. This way you do not need to write any `down` methods, which might save some time


## How does Laravel deal with the slowness that comes with the Reflection API?
* You usually do not resolve enough stuff in a request to experience the slowdown. If you look at a controller, you might only have like 3-4 dependancies.
* Haven't done anything special in the framework to mitigate the slowness
* Taylor's first open source project was a reflection based DI container he wrote back in 2010. It was written for the Code Igniter community. The container in Laravel is similar to the one he wrote years ago.

## Whats a good way to decouple routing with the container?
* They are integrated at that point, so you just have to deal with it

## Laracast
* [Laracast](http://laracasts.com) is like the Netflix for developers
* A great resource on Laravel besides the documentation
* In general, Jeffery usually releases one or two videos at a time
* Jeffery has been working on [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/mix) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) in a [new series](http://webpackcasts.com/) recently. He is also working on a series where he [builds a forum from scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel)

## Any advice on creating your own screencast business?
* You need to update it often
* If you are in the content business, you need a steady stream of stuff
* When building a site, if you use 3rd party packages, make sure you trust the maintainer. You don't want them to end support and you are stuck with their old code

## What is the typical upgrade path of the Laracast site?
* Usually updates at every minor release
* Probably updates more often than many other Laravel production enviroments

## Why Laravel 5.5 instead of 6?
* Laravel uses a slightly different versioning scheme, which is laid out in the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/releases#versioning-scheme)
* Major numbers are used when there is a paradime shift in the framework
* As of the time of the recording, there is no plan for Laravel 6. The Laravel 5 architecture and structure has been working out and there is no need to change everything.
* For minor releases, the second number in the the release version, some minor breaking changes can be introduced. Taylor's guideline is to try to keep the changes low enough that a developer can update to the latest minor release within a day's worth of work 

## What is Laravel.io?
* It started out in 2013 with [Shawn McCool](http://shawnmc.cool/) as the original maintainer. Now maintained by Dries Vints
* [Laravel.io](https://laravel.io/) is a discussion forum for developers
* The source code for the site is on [Github](https://github.com/laravelio)
* The next version of the site should come out a month or two after this recording. It is a total rewrite

## A Docker based solution like Laravel Homestead or Laravel Valet
* There is nothing official, but [Laradock](http://laradock.io/) is the closet thing
* It is very common that people roll their own solution

## Other Laravel Stuff
* [Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/) A SaaS framework
* [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) A micro framework based on Laravel
* Bunch of official packages
	* [Cashier](http://laravel.com/docs/billing) Help with doing billing and subscriptions using either Stripe or Braintree
	* [Envoy](http://laravel.com/docs/envoy) A remote task runner. It can SSH to a box and run commands
	* [Passport](http://laravel.com/docs/master/passport) A Oauth2 server implementation for Laravel
	* [Scout](http://laravel.com/docs/master/scout) Adds full-text search to Eloquent models
	* [Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) Social Media authentication. Providers like Github, Facebook, Twitter, built-in. Lots of community driven providers listed [here](https://socialiteproviders.github.io/)

## Laravel Sneak Peak
* [Horizon](http://laravel.com/docs/master/horizon) will come out at Laracon 2017
* Next big thing might come out at the end of 2017, but most likely 2018
