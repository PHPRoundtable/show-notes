# Summary
[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) has been a design principle that the PHP community has embraced more fully than a lot of other programming communities. There's even an official PHP-FIG standard being discussed called [PSR-11](https://github.com/container-interop/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/container.md) which will standardize dependency injection containers. Today we chat all things dependency injection.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What does dependency injection give us?
* Flexibility
* Avoids tight coupling
* Allows component re-use
* Provides separation of concerns
* Makes objects more testable
* Provides inversion of control

## How do we implement dependency injection?
* Pass in objects we need as parameters
* Avoid the `new` keyword inside our object code
* Push object instantiation outside of our objects (this is where DI containers can help us)

## When should we use dependency injection?
* Services or Repositories which we want to exchange within our code base
* Anywhere we want to be able to use more than one implementation
* Anywhere we want to be able to swap out an object under testing
* Sometimes we can directly instantiate objects, for example domain objects and helper classes

## What role do [interfaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php) play in dependency injection?
* Interfaces help us to decouple dependencies from their implementation
* We should be able to exchange a dependency with another that conforms to the same interface
* There are some things an interface doesn't capture (e.g: the exceptions that can be thrown by a method)

## Which tools can we use to help with dependency injection?
PHP dependency injection containers fall into one of 3 categories:
* Pure PHP:
  * [Pimple](https://pimple.sensiolabs.org/)
  * [Disco](https://github.com/bitExpert/disco)
* Configuration file-based:
  * [Symfony DependencyInjection Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html) can optionally work in this way
* Reflection-based/"autowiring":
  * [Laravel IoC](https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/ioc)

## PSR-11
* [PSR-11](https://github.com/container-interop/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/container.md) addresses one problem: How do we fetch an object from a container?
* 2 methods: `get()` and `has()`
* Many components (e.g: frameworks or routers) are currently tightly coupled to a particular container implementation
* Standardising container implementation will help to make components more generic

## How did dependency injection become so popular in PHP?
* As unit testing has become more important, so has DI. The two compliment each other
* The first versions of frameworks like Zend and Symfony were monolithic. In version 2 these frameworks started to split into smaller components. Using dependency injection helped them to decouple.
* Early implementations borrowed/ported the concept from [Spring](https://spring.io/) in Java
