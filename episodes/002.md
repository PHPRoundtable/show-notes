* Sammy's B.S. in Linguistics does not help him pronounce [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jmikola)'s last name properly.
* How to wrap our heads around functional programming:
	* "Functional programming is to imperative programming as a curve is to a derivative."
	* There is no such thing as a point on a curve, but there are approximations.
	* "State" doesn't exist in real life so we don't use it in functional programming
* SammyK has amazing show notes.
* What is state?
	* State is holding data around in memory
* Mutable vs Immutable
	* Mutable: can be changed
	* Immutable: cannot be changed
* Unix piping in the command line is an example of functional programming
* Closures are [anonymous functions](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php) that can be assigned to a variable
* Functional programming
	* Functional programming can be done with an imperative programming language like PHP, but there are native functional programming languages like [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell).
	* State happens in a very small context
"[Functional Programming in PHP](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/functional-programming-in-php--net-35043)" by Patkos Csaba says there are three guidelines to functional programming in PHP: 1. **No assignments.**, 2. **No mutable state.**, and 3. **No `while` or `for` loops**.
* Glen mentions [referential transparency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)) and minds explode.
* Persistent data sources get a "pass" in functional programming since they store state.
* Immutable values
	* Immutable values make testing easier.
	* DateTime has an [immutable version](http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetimeimmutable.php).
	* [Primitives in PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.intro.php) are essentially value objects.
	* To change the state of an immutable object, create a new one.
* Recursion
	* Recursion
		* [Recursion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is used instead of `while` or `for` loops in functional programming.
* We take a PHP elePHPant break.
* [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/) has a [Failraptor](http://blog.kraih.com/post/43196557952/failraptor).
* [ReactPHP](http://reactphp.org/) is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O library.
	* The name comes from the [reactor pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern).
	* We compare ReactPHP to [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
* [Non-blocking I/O](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O) vs [multi-threading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture))
Examples of using non-blocking I/O: q web server, a web scrapper & other apps that use other web protocols (not just * HTTP) like [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/).
* PHP is a great language to run from the command line.
* Some discussion on how single-threaded languages make use of an [event loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) to perform non-blocking I/O.
* What we use ReactPHP for:
	* Jeremy uses it to communicate with child processes in the MongoDB PHP diver test suite.
	* Most common uses are web socket apps.
	* It's possible to use it for MySQL driver communications.
* In PHP 5.6, the [PostgreSQL driver supports asynchronous connections and queries](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.postgresql).
* We talk about how ReactPHP can help us program functionally in PHP.
* [Igor](https://github.com/igorw) has some great functionally programmed repos.
* Something old, something new, something borrowed, something deprecated
	* Old & Awesome: PHP streams (again lol)
	* New & Cool: Anything off of [Nikita Popov's blog](https://nikic.github.io/).
	* Borrowed: PHP steals pretty much everything
	* Deprecated: [Pear](http://pear.php.net/)
