# Summary
We chat about the open-source Behavior-Driven Development framework called [Behat](http://behat.org/). We get a brief overview of how Behat can help us write more reliable code and also explore some best-practices when writing automated tests.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What does Behat do?
* Behat is a [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) tool
* Behat is even more BDD-specific than [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) or [phpspec](http://www.phpspec.net/en/stable/)
* Behat separates semantics of problem description from automated tests
* Behat can be seen more as a tool for documentation and specification than testing in the sense of removing bugs

## How do we decide what to test with Behat?
* The [testing pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/testPyramid/test-pyramid.png)
* We should have the lowest number of the tests which are the slowest to run
* We can mock out external services in acceptance tests in the same way we use mocks and stubs in unit testing
* If your test suite takes longer than 10 minutes, you have big problems
* Favour lower-levels tests where possible

## How can Behat help us to modernize legacy applications?
* Write end-to-end tests with Behat to define expected behaviour
* Refactor underlying code into more defined 'layers' using acceptance tests to ensure we have not broken anything
* As we refactor, replace slower acceptance tests with faster lower-level (unit/integration) tests
* Only keep the most important acceptance tests

## How do we isolate layers (esp. the UI layer) so we don't need end-to-end tests?
* If our UI talks to the back end via REST, point it at a fake back-end
* Use BDD or unit testing tools for javascript
* Write feature files in a UI-agnostic way
* If your tests are entangled, your application will be entangled
* The same descriptions can be used with Behat and [Cucumber JS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js). This allows your UI and back-end to be tested against the same specification

## How do we write good user stories?
* User stories should be the result of a **conversation** between developers and users
* Keep the discussion high-level
* Focus on understanding the problem, not the implementation details

## How do we get started with Behat in a project that already has Unit Tests?
* Behat expects to find a top-level dir called `/features` for specifications
* `/features` does not contain tests - think of `/features` as documentation as well as specification
* Within `/tests`, divide tests into `/unit`, `/integration`, `/acceptance` and namespace them
* The content of `/features` should be human-readable, describe features to be used by humans and be implementation-agnostic

## How do we acceptance test a user interaction with many variations?
* We don't need to explicitly test every scenario end-to-end
* Create scenario outlines with multiple examples
* Identify the most critical paths and focus testing on those
