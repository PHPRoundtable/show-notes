# Summary
Adding tests to php-src is a great way to get involved with PHP internals. Don't know how to get started? You're in luck. [TestFest 2017](https://phptestfest.org/) is going to be a thing in September. User groups and individuals around the world are going to organize to learn how to add tests to PHP and become official internals contributors.

It has been 7 years since the last [TestFest in 2010](https://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest-2010). We chat about how to get involved with TestFest 2017.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

# How do I get involved?
* TestFest runs from September - December 2017
* Join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/phpcommunity.org/forum/#!forum/testfest)
* Attend an event
* If you are a user group, run one or more events where you:
  * Introduce TestFest
  * Explain what PHPT tests are and how to create them
  * Explain how to contribute them
  * Help everyone to get set up
  * Hold a mini-hackathon where devs write tests for PHP and help each other
  * Sammy's [Video Tutorials](https://phptestfest.org/tutorials/writing-tests-for-php-source/) provide some teaching materials
  * [docker-phpqa](https://phptestfest.org/tutorials/phpqa-tutorial/) can help devs to get an environment up-and-running quickly
  * Contribute the tests to [php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src)
  
# Do I need to know C to contribute tests?
* The tests themselves are not written in C. They are written in PHP.
* To find untested code, you will need to read some C code to understand the coverage reports at http://gcov.php.net/
* You don't need to be able to fully parse the code in order to do this
* There is some internals documentation at [PHP Internals Book](http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/)
