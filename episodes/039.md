## Problems Encountered
* Time
* Finding an ORM to work with graph database - [neo4j](http://neo4j.com/)
* The ideal solution vs sticking with what you know
* Building a single page load web app

## Where next?
* Review of priorities:
    * Event curation: back end done, front end in progress
    * Event discovery: done
    * Calendar integration: not done
    * Participant accounts: back end done, front end in progress
    * Event subscription: not started - some discussion around how this should work/feature ideas:
        * GitHub terminology ("watch" and "star") vs Facebook terminology ("going" and "like")
        * Subscribe by event/subscribe by region
        * What events might a user be interested in subscribing to (e.g: venue/accommodation/schedule changes) - could these be handled using Laravel events?
        * Live push notifications (schedule events, "milestones") + opt-in or aggregation to avoid spamming users
    * Real data: not yet, but this is high priority
    * Invitations/partner management: not done
    * How do entities in the data model relate to each other - series/groups? Some discussion of polymorphic data model.
    * Should endpoints be context-aware?
    * What data would API users like to consume?
        * Event attendees - stats/badges, biographies
        * Event directors - what services are on offer that I could use?
* What goes into the next iteration - long list:
    * Finish Event curation
    * Participant accounts
    * Event subscription/notifications
    * Partner management
    * Pro Schedule
    * Gamification/milestones
    * Event rating system
* What goes into the next iteration - short list:
    * Finish Event curation
    * Participant accounts
    * Event subscription
