## Discussion - The panel talks about...

### Static Code Analyzers

Static code analysis tools maintained by the guests:

* [Exakat](https://www.exakat.io/)
* [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
* [PHP Inspections (EA Extended)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7622-php-inspections-ea-extended-) and [PHP Inspections (EA Ultimate)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10215-php-inspections-ea-ultimate-)

### Learnings and Recommendations

In no particular order:

* Start simple by installing one of these or other tools and let it analyze your code base.
* Integrate static code analysis into your continuous integration process.
* Most tools support error levels so you can fine-tune your checks.
* Go for easy fixes that stand out in your code base first.
* Static code analysis is useful for PHP projects because PHP does not have a compiler ([yet](https://externals.io/message/102415#102415) ;-)).

### Misc
