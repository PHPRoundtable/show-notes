# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## PHP has been seeing more regular releases recently - what changed?
* PHP adheres to semantic versioning more closely now. In the past this was not the case
* A lot of time was spent on [PHP 6](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/what-happened-to-php-6) which never happened
* PHP has settled into a more mature yearly release cadence and [support policy](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)

## Davey talks about his role as release manager for 7.1?
* Answered a call on PHP Internals list
* Davey and [Joe Watkins](https://github.com/krakjoe) were approved as co-release managers
* Received a lot of help from others e.g: Stephen from Microsoft (Windows binaries) and Remi from Redhat (testing on RHEL, Fedora, CentOS)
* Primarily about housekeeping:
  * Publishing and signing tarballs
  * Ensuring there are no unintended BC-breaks
  * Ensuring nothing is added that isn't approved
