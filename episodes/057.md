# Summary
There's a lot more going on at [Zend](http://www.zend.com/) other than [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com/). We chat about the Zend ecosystem, from [Apigility](https://apigility.org/) to [Zend Certification](http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification) and what Zend's role is in PHP internals.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## The company behind Zend
* Zend Engine is a pre-compiler for PHP and is used internally in PHP's interpreter
* The Zend company and other products grew out of this
* Zend is [now owned by Rogue Wave](http://www.zend.com/en/resources/news-and-events/newsroom/press/3683_rogue-wave-software-acquires-enterprise-php-leader-zend-acquisition-broadens-enterprise-strength-across-top-five-development-languages)

## What is Zend's role in PHP Internals?
* [Rogue Wave](http://www.roguewave.com/) employs a number of PHP core contributors
* [Dmitry Stogov](https://twitter.com/dstogov) developed much of the basis for the PHP 7 Engine (codenamed [phpng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#NG) at the time) while at Zend
* Dmitry and others at Rogue Wave are working on JIT-compilation for PHP

## The Zend Framework
* Component-based framework
* Focusses on configuration over 'magic'
* Promotes best-practices and maintainability over rapid development
* Used by a lot of large organisations
* Backed by a stable company

## What's new in version 3?
* The framework is now decoupled across 61 'component' repositories instead of all the components living in a single repository - this promotes component re-use
* Contains multiple [backwards-incompatible changes](https://github.com/zendframework/zendframework/wiki/ZF-3.0-Backwards-Compatibility-Breaks), but upgrading from 2.x is not too much of a headache and [well documented](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-mvc/migration/to-v3-0/)
* Improved performance
* Improved developer experience
* Improved [documentation](https://docs.zendframework.com/)

## Apigility
* A quick way to create database-connected APIs
* Handles a lot of the overhead/boilerplate associated with creating APIs:
  * error handling
  * content negotiation
  * versioning
  * etc

## PHP and Zend Framework Certification
* Proves you understand PHP and current best-practices
* Focussed on core PHP concepts, rather than language features of a particular version of PHP
