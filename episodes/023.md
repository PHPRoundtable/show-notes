# Summary
Inspired by a lively Open Spaces session at [php|tek 2015](http://tek.phparch.com/), we discuss how PHP's ecosystem could be threatened by a not-so-obvious [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) and what we can all do to keep things thriving.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...
## Intro
* Definition of [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)
* Samantha discusses her talk at php|tek 2015 "Open Sourcing Teams", which provided the inspiration for this podcast topic.
* The panel quickly decides that 'getting hit by a bus' is unnecessarily morbid. For the rest of the podcast, we can read 'getting hit by a bus' as 'retiring' or 'winning the lottery' :)
* How do we measure/express bus factor - does a project with 2 crucial contributors have a bus factor of 2 or 0.5? The panel agrees on 2. A low bus factor is bad, a high bus factor is good.

## Which important PHP projects have a low bus factor?
The panel discusses some popular PHP projects and their maintainers/contributors:
* [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](https://mwop.net/) - [Zend](http://framework.zend.com/)
* [Fabien Potencier](http://fabien.potencier.org/) - [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
* [Taylor Otwell](http://taylorotwell.com/) - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
* [Jordi Boggiano](https://seld.be/), [Nils Aderman](http://naderman.de/) - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Sebastian Bergmann](https://sebastian-bergmann.de/), [Stefan Priebsch](http://www.priebsch.de/), [Arne Blankerts](https://twitter.com/arneblankerts) - [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)

Do these maintainers represent a bus factor of one in the context of these projects?

## How does over-reliance on one individual impact developers using a framework/platform?
* If we use these tools in (commercial) projects, there is risk associated with uncertain future of the project
* Reliance on a single maintainer does not represent the only risk associated with building on top of open source frameworks/packages
* One of the advantages of commercial software backed by large companies/organisations is greater stability in this respect

## How do we evaluate open source software for use in projects?
* Quality of documentation
* Size/strength of community - network effects
* In a worst case scenario (e.g: the project is abandoned), could we maintain a fork?

## How can we identify projects with a low bus-factor?
* This is a hard judgement to make
* The majority of users/developers are not sufficiently involved in the PHP community to make this judgement
* Sometimes projects fail/disappear/fall out of favour due to other reasons (osCommerce and Lithium are cited as examples)
* High bus-factor does not guarantee stability

## How can we mitigate against this?
* Projects with clean standards-compliant code will be easier for others to maintain
* Projects where the reasoning/philosophy behind the project is well explained will be easier for others to maintain
* One reason a project maintainer may be forced to step away is financial constraints. In the Ruby community, they attempt to mitigate this risk against core projects with [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/)
* Form/encourage community around projects and contribute to projects
* [PHP Mentoring](https://phpmentoring.org/)
* Companies that depend on open source projects should contribute to those projects - the cost to businesses of contributing now is far smaller than the cost of an important project that they depend on disappearing in future
* Developers and businesses should support open source projects e.g: by buying licences for their premium/commercial services
* Project maintainers should welcome help and contributions from others
* Project maintainers should produce good quality documentation
* Project maintainers should produce contributing guidelines

## Does PHP Internals have a low bus factor?
* [PHP Internals](http://news.php.net/php.internals) has many maintainers and contributors, but some specific components have serious problems. For example:
  * [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) does not have an active maintainer
  * [mcrypt](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php) does not have an active maintainer
