Big thank you to Jeffrey for continuosly sponsoring the "Developer Shout Out" on PHPRoundTable, gives PHPRoundTable the ability to give developers lots of money for being awesome!

Technical difficulties begin happening almost immediately. And the show pretty much wraps. I guess the Hyatt didn't like the bandwidth being used up by the PHPRoundTable. We assure you, the show was great.
