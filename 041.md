# Summary
The [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) has really helped the PHP community get onboard the collaboration train with really great standards like the PSR-4 autoloading standard and the PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces.

We discuss PSR-0 through PSR-13 and the process they go through to become standards. We also discuss where the FIG came from and the possible big changes coming to the organization soon.

# Discussion - The panel talks about...

## What was the PHP Community like before the FIG?
* Poor communication and co-operation
* Frameworks started to establish standards
* Multiple competing standards/framework-specific standards
* [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/) was the closest thing to a standards body
* [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) represented the first step towards the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/), but it wasn't called PSR-0 at the time. It was just 'an autoloading standard'

## What is the role of a PHP-FIG secretary?
* Admin tasks
* Vote tracking
* Co-ordination
* Point of contact
* Impartial - not representing a particular project

## What process does a PSR go through to become a standard?
* See [PSR workflow](http://www.php-fig.org/bylaws/psr-workflow/) for full process. Core steps are:
* Proposal
* Entrance vote
* PSR is assigned a number
* Draft
* Review
* Final acceptance vote
* Sometimes this takes a long time. [PSR-6](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) took over 4 years to become a standard

## Changes in the PHP-FIG's approach
* The PHP-FIG is currently undergoing an identity crisis and drafting new by-laws
* Historically, the FIG has strived to arrive at a 'perfect' standard and set it in stone
* The group is moving towards a model where standards can evolve
* One approach being considered is that a PSR must have 2 interoperable real-world implementations before standardisation
* Standards can now be deprecated - this is a new status. [PSR-0](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/) is now deprecated in favour of [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
* [PSR-12](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/extended-coding-style-guide.md) will deprecate [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/)
* A new status 'abandoned' will also be introduced for standards which are no longer actively being drafted

## PSRs currently in draft
* [PSR-5](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed) - PHPDoc Standard
* [PSR-9](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/security-disclosure-publication.md) - Security disclosure and [PSR-10](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/security-reporting-process.md) - Security Advisories (related)
* [PSR-8](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/psr-8-hug/psr-8-hug.md) - Huggable Interface (an April fools joke).
  * There is actual legitimate debate on whether this should be abandoned or implemented
  * Supporters of PSR-8 cite examples such as [IP over Avian Carrier](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt) and [HTTP Status code 418](https://httpstatuses.com/418) as grounds to ratify
* [PSR-11](https://github.com/container-interop/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/container.md) - Container Interface
* [PSR-13](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/links.md) - Hypermedia Links

## Why are [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) different?
* Originally they were one document - it failed to pass twice
* Coding style is a controversial topic
* Splitting into 2 standards was a way to successfully ratify it
* PSR-1 deals with the most important/least controversial aspects of coding style
* PSR-2 deals with aspects that are less important/more open to interpretation
* The panel talks tabs vs spaces (yeah they went there!)
* [PSR-12](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/extended-coding-style-guide.md) will deprecate [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) updates PSR-2 to deal with new additions to the language in PHP7 e.g: [Return type hints](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types)
* PSR-1 will not be deprecated

There is an [entire episode](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/psr-7-streams-immutability-middleware-oh-my) on PSR-7

## What is the role of PHP-FIG in the community
The panel discusses the role of the PHP-FIG - there are a variety of opinions, both complimentary and conflicting.

## Where is the PHP-FIG going in future?
* [Member projects](http://www.php-fig.org/members/) vote on PSRs, but there are some problems:
  * It is difficult to achieve quorum
  * Not everyone is engaged
  * Not all of the members are engaged with/knowledgable about every topic
* A new structure aims to solve some of these problems:
  * Working group structure: people who know/care about the topic become involved in the working group for that specific PSR
  * Core committee
    * Specifications are reviewed by the core committee
    * They don't handle the **content** of the PSR - just a final QA (e.g: ensure 2 working interoperable implementations)
  * The member projects include the community in the FIG and lend weight to the FIG, but they don't all have to have input on every PSR
