## Sammy Kaye Introduces
* Eight FIG members - quite a few people!

## Intro
* Misnomers - Phil Sturgeon didn't start the phpfig :lol: (David & Travis were the instigators according to Cal & Paul [53:28](https://youtu.be/tAHfoh641wM?t=3208)).
* Puntastic fun.
* What the landscape was like before FIG. Code was used from PEAR, phpclasses and the likes. Then Frameworks came along and whee...! [3:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=189)
* PEAR and the PEAR Standards get mentioned a lot [5:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=307); [5:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=352)  and sound like they were used as the main foundation for the first few PSRs[6:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=374). But the PEAR Standards didn't keep up with the changing landscape - autoloaders. Evert sounds like he misses PEAR as it was/is more than just a Coding Standard :( [7:04] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=424)
* Backlash from the general community. [8:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=507)
* What FIG Secretaries do (mostly admin work, don't vote on PSRs it seems).

##Formality
* By-Laws, and why they came to be.
* Secretaries [9:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=593)
* Deprecation Status (PSR12 will deprecate PSR2).


## Changes
* Might require at least two implementions for each proposed PSR in the future.
* PSR12 will deprecate PSR2
* Michael explains PSRs 9 & 10.
* Paul M. Jones explains that PSRs 1 and 2 were once just the one document and
  split in two to make them more likely to be adopted.
* Sammy explaining Tabs v Spaces to his dance partner [39:30](https://youtu.be/tAHfoh641wM?t=2375).
* People want a Standards Body, says Samantha. [59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=3543)

## And out of the FIG came Composer
* Composer born out of the FIG Autoloading PSRs, according to Matthew [56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHfoh641wM&t=3394)

## Other April Fools Documents (PSR-8 is one).
* [HTTP Tea Pot Status Response](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.3.2)
* [IP over Avian Carrier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149)

## Where the FIG is going  [1:03:53](https://youtu.be/tAHfoh641wM?t=3837)...Not offically proposed yet!
### A more formalised working group structure
### A core committee, representing community and member projects.
* Specifications go through them.
* Making sure 2 working implementations.
* They ensure the spec has matured.
* Quality assurance of the specs in a way.
